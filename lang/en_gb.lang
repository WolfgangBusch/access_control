#   documentation help
access_control_help           = This AddOn offers access control on sectors of articles or media files, respectively.<br/>The authorization for access requires the specification of name and password of a community user and is stored in a session variable.<br/>Only one simple rewrite rule is required.<br/>The AddOn is designed completely bilingual (german, english).
#   documentation description
access_control_descr_head1    = Protected area
access_control_descr_par1     = It is possible to protect all articles and all media files located in the path below a special category or media category, respectively. Appropriate categories are to be set on the configuration page. It is no limitation to provide exactly one protected category and one protected media category ("protected area"), because every article and every media file can be protected by moving it properly.
access_control_descr_head2    = Member user
access_control_descr_par2     = The AddOn provides a module for displaying a sign-in form where visitors can authenticate to access protected areas. A corresponding user name and an associated password can be configured. By knowing this access data, the visitor becomes a member of a community. - The sign-in is session based.<br/>An authenticated Redaxo editor is authorized to access, independently.
access_control_descr_head3    = Forbidden area
access_control_descr_par3     = Furthermore the site administrator can set a category in the configuration below which only he can view articles as soon as he is logged in ("forbidden area").
access_control_descr_head4    = Access authorization check
access_control_descr_par4     = In the absence of access authorization, an error image will automatically be displayed instead of the requested media file. Checking whether a requested article is public, protected or forbidden can be done by using an AddOn function, meaningfully in the page template. At this place a corresponding error message can be displayed instead of the article content.
#   documentation details

access_control_details_par1b  = To verify the access authorization on a media file at first the file name must be determined from its file address. In case of the second format it can easily be separated as address parameter. So the first format is transformed into this one
access_control_details_par1c  = by correspondingly rewriting the address
